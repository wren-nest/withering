    <p style="font-size: 20px; color:#ffffff; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">
        This room is dripping with viscous liquid.<br><br>

        Before you notice anything else, the smell hits you. It's metallic, 
        so sharp that it burns the back of your throat.<br><br>

        The space is lit by nothing but moonlight pouring in from a shrouded window.<br><br>

        The light is so dim you can't even see colour, just the shape of things, 
        and the dark stains of the sludge over them.<br><br>
        
        Gunk is dripping down the walls, splattered over the tables and 
        chairs. The space is arranged as a dining room, it seems.<br><br>

        You hear a heavy 'schlop' as some of the liquid hits the floor. <br><br>

        You draw back the curtain. You don't think to look outside. You know there is Nothing to see.<br><br>

        The moon is bright outside, and you can finally see the sludge...<br>
        <span style="color: #581212;">it's deep red. The blood is thick and bubbling.</span><br><br>

        'Shlap!' More <span style="color: #581212;">blood</span> leaks from the empty light fixture and falls onto the table.<br><br>
        
        Looking back where you entered, you realise the doorway has not brightened. 
        The darkness immune to light is here, and creeping into the edge of your vision the 
        longer you look at it.<br><br>

        You feel your legs begin to move before you even think to leave.<br>
        There are two ways out, a grand wooden door opposite where you entered 
        and a smaller, understated door to your right.
