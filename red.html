        This room is dripping with Viscous liquid.<br><br>

        Before you notice anything else, the smell hits you. It's metallic, 
        so sharp that it burns the back of your throat.<br><br>

        The space is lit by nothing but Moonlight pouring in from a shrouded window.<br><br>

        The light is so dim you can't even see colour, just the shape of things, 
        and the dark stains of the Sludge over them.<br><br>
        
        Gunk is dripping down the walls, splattered over the Tables and 
        chairs. The space is arranged as a dining room, it seems.<br><br>

        You hear a heavy 'schlop' as some of the liquid hits the floor. <br><br>

        You draw back the curtain. You don't think to look outside. You know there is Nothing to see.<br><br>

        The Moon is bright outside, and you can finally see that the goo... it's deep red. 
        The blood is thick and bubbling.<br><br>

        'Shlap!' More blood leaks from the empty light fixture and falls onto the table.<br><br>
        
        Looking back where you entered, you realise the doorway has not brightened. 
        The darkness immune to light is here, and creeping into your vision the 
        longer you look at it.<br><br>

        You feel your legs move before you decide to leave.<br>
        There are two ways out, a grand wooden door opposite where you entered 
        and a smaller door to your right.
