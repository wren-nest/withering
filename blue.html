        This room smells of wheat and, faintly, honey. This seems unrelated to the space.<br>

        This room is a bathroom, with cold tiled floors and green paisly wallpaper.
        You question that thought. This room lacks all furnishings of a bathroom.
        How do you know it is one?
        
        The only feature of the space are an array of mirrors. Wide mirrors line every wall,
        and mirrors of every shape and size are scattered about the room.

        They lean against the walls, along the floor. A mirrored box holds a pile of hand 
        mirrors atop it. 

        After a moment of looking around, you realise why you thought this was a bathroom. <br>
