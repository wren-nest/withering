    <h1 style="font-size:60px; color:#ffffff; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">The Jetty</h1>
</body>

<body>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; color:#ffffff; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">
        You are outdoors. There are three rickety wooden steps that lead down 
        to a short jetty. The lake glitters under a the full moon. There are no stars.<br><br>

        Looking back at the door you came out of, there's only Nothing there. The entire structure 
        is consumed with it. The creaky steps jut out of the darkness unnaturally. You look away.<br><br>
        
        This lake is lined by thick woods, and you have no way to reach the shore.<br>
        A rowboat is floating a in the middle of the water, out of reach.<br><br>

        You can see the rope it was moored with hanging loose into the water. <br>
        You wonder how far down it goes.<br><br>

        Part of you wants to jump in the water and follow the rope down as far as it may lead.<br>
        Your better judgement suggests otherwise.</p>

        <p class="flip" onclick="myFunction()" style="font-size: 22px; color:#ffffff; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">
            Pull up the rope?  <span style="color:#6a707c;">(Click here)</span></p>
    
        <div id="panel" style="font-size: 20px; color:#ffffff; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">
        <p>You dredge the slimey rope up out of the water<br><br>
    
            Something is attatched to it, something heavy. You haul it onto the jetty.<br>
            A bundle tied together with a hasty knot at the end of the rope.<br><br>
    
            You open it, and find inside a strange assortment of trinkets. Photo frames with cracked glass, 
            a bracelet so tarnished you can't tell what it once was, shards of coloured 
            porceline that may have once been a sculpure or plate.<br><br>
    
            The fabric that bundled them together seems odd too, it's thick like a curtain, but is torn along 
            two sides so you have no way of knowing what it was cut from.<br></p>
        </div>
    
        <script>
        function myFunction() {
        document.getElementById("panel").style.display = "block";
        }
    </script>

        <p style="font-size: 20px; color:#ffffff; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">You think to glance back at the house, and see that it isn't hidden by the Nothing, 
        rather it is just sitting in natural shadow. You head back toward it but something is different.<br><br>

        The stairs are new, and the door looks different to the way you came in before.<br>
        A tattered flyscreen door is left open, cobwebs hanging between it and the doorframe.<br>
        Behind it is a plain green door with a simple round handle. The edges of old wood painted wood 
        curl away, swollen with age like old joints.<br><br>

        With a firm tug, the door opens to a hallway.<br>
        This definetly isn't the way you came before.
