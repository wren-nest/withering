    <h1 style="font-size:30px; color:#d7ba79; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">The Sitting Room</h1>
</body>

<body>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; color:#e5d6b5; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">
        This room is lit by candlelight.<br><br>

        There are two armchairs and a lounge. They are carved of beautiful mahogany wood,
        detailed with intricately chizled patterns, and upholstered with rich red velvet.<br><br>

        The floor is carpeted, and in the center of the room are indents left by the feet of
         another peice of furniture that has been moved. It has left a long, round imprint in the carpet.<br><br>

        It seems to be shaped like a boat, eliptical and pointed at both ends.<br><br>

        Opposite you is a fireplace, unlit and empty. The only thing on the mantle is a picture frame, face down.
        
            <p class="flip" onclick="myFunction()" style="font-size: 22px; color:#e5d6b5; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">
            Pick up the frame?  <span style="color:#837d70;">(Click here)</span></p>
        
            <div id="panel">
            <p>The glass of the frame is broken, some of it falls onto the mantle as you pick it up.<br><br>

                There's nothing to see inside, just the white backing of the frame.<br>
                You fix the stand at the back of the frame and sit it upright on the mantle.
            </p>
            </div>
        
            <script>
            function myFunction() {
            document.getElementById("panel").style.display = "block";
            }
        </script>

            <p style="font-size:20px; color:#e5d6b5; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">
              Looking around the room again, you notice that you stepped over the imprint 
              in the carpet, leaving footprints over the perfect imprint.<br><br>

              Or you must have done without realisng, no one else has been in here.
            </p>

    You look at the fireplace again. It seems like it goes back through the wall rather than having 
    space going up. You think you could crawl inside quite easily.<br>

    The only other way forward is through a door you initially mistook as a cupboard 
    because of its understated desgin.<br><br>


    Which way will you go?<br><br>
