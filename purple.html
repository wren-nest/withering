        This room is lit by candlelight.<br><br>

        There are two armchairs and a lounge. They are carved of beautiful mahogany wood,
        detailed with intricately chizled patterns, and upholstered with rich red velvet.<br><br>

        The floor is carpeted, and in the center of the room are indents left by the feet of
         another peice of furniture that has been moved. It has left a long, round imprint in the carpet.<br><br>

        It seems to be shaped like a boat, eliptical and pointed at both ends. This is 
        probably a coincidence.<br><br>

        Opposite you is a fireplace, unlit and empty. The only thing on the mantle
