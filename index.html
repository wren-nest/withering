    You are in an empty room.<br><br>

    The space is lit by a single yellowed lightbulb mounted to the wall. 
    To your left is a battered leather couch covered in a thick layer of dust. 
    You can see the imprint where Someone sat recently.<br><br>

    The only other furniture is a wooden coffee table with elegantly carved legs. 
    Gaps in the dust show where items- perhaps photo frames, or a tea set- once were.<br><br>

    Stained wallpaper is peeling off the walls. Floorboards creak underfoot. 
    The air is thick as soup, swimming with grime and rot.<br><br>

    You hear something dripping from the ceiling above you, 
    falling somewhere just ahead of you. <br>
    You try to look for the source of the sound.<br>
    But looking up, you see... Nothing.<br>
    Ahead of you too, only darkness.<br><br>

    Even where the flickering light 
    should illuminate it, the end of the room before you is shrouded in shadow.<br><br><br>


    Darkness begins to creep into the edges of your vision.<br>
    You rub your eyes, but it doesn't go away.<br><br><br>


    <b>You know you cannot stay here.</b><br><br><br>


    The space before you is shrouded in darkness. You can just barely 
    make out the shape of a doorframe.<br>
    Walking through, you can't see 
    your hand before your face, like it isn't there at all.<br><br>
