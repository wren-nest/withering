    <p style="font-size: 20px; color:#ffffff; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">
        <span style="color: #eaf2ed;">This room smells something like wheat and, faintly, honey. 
        It reminds you of the hospital.</span><br><br>

        <span style="color: #d1eedb;">This room is a bathroom, with cold tiled floors and green paisly wallpaper. 
        Harsh strip lights along the ceiling leave little room for shadows.</span><br><br>

        <span style="color: #bae7ca;">You question your thought. This room lacks all furnishings of a bathroom.<br>
        How do you know it is one?</span><br><br>
        
        <span style="color: #a2dfb7;">The only feature of the space are an array of mirrors. Wide mirrors line every wall,
        and mirrors of every shape and size are scattered about the room.</span><br><br>

        <span style="color: #88d1a2;">They lean against the walls, along the floor. A mirrored box holds a pile of hand 
        mirrors atop it.</span><br><br>

        <span style="color: #71be93;">After a moment of looking around, you realise why you thought this was a bathroom. <br>
        The space is filled with your reflection from every angle, 
        and reflections of those reflections. In some places you can hardly 
        see yourself through the blue-green haze of the mirrors on mirrors on mirrors.</span><br><br>

        <span style="color: #5da88b;">You find two mirrors reflecting into eachother, and try to look at the furthest reflection.<br>
        You note how the image gets darker, more distorted with every reflection of itself.</span><br><br>

        <span style="color: #4d8a7d;">There is something behind you. Looking over your shoulder, the door you came in through is gone.<br>
        Now it's just Nothing, a rectangle cut out of reality.</span><br><br>

        <span style="color: #386f68;">The darkness leaks toward you, creeping like spilt oil 
        across the tiles. You turn to leave.</span><br><br><br>

        <span style="color: #a7ded7;">You can see two ways out. 
        In the far corner of the room is an air vent. The grate over 
        it is loose and it looks like you could fit inside easily. 
        Otherwise there is a panel of mirror with a door handle inset into it.
        Opening it you see only darkness behind it.</span>
