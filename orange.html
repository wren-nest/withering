    <h1 style="font-size:30px; color:#ffffff; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">The Greenhouse</h1>
</body>

    <p style="font-size:20px; color:#ffffff; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">
      You enter the greenhouse, and are immedietly shocked by the cold. It feels unnaturally cool here, 
      not only far too cold for exotic plants to grow, but also far colder than it is outdoors. But far more 
      overwhelming is the smell. This room reeks of rot and death. Your stomach churns.<br><br>

      This room is open to the sky, lit by pale moonlight. The glass roof of this greenhouse is clouded by 
      grime and cobwebs, and a patchy layer of old leaves has collected over the roof, making the light 
      mottled and dull. At the far corner, however, several pannels of glass have broken 
      and bright moonlight pours in.<br><br>

      You note the dead and shriveled vines that once climbed the span of the roof. Some dry stems have come 
      loose and hang from the ceiling alongside long strands of cobwebs.<br><br>

      The garden beds are dry, and barren of any hint of green. There are pleanty of shriveled plants 
      of incredible variety. There are dead bushes with rotten berries of all kinds dripping over stiff leaves. 
      In one corner is a giant pumpkin, caved in on itself and shriveled almost beyond recognition. 
      A rusted cart holds empty pots, you imagine young seeds waiting to sprout but never getting the opportunity. 
      Several trellises are covered in the grotesque pulp of whatever fruits rotted off them. Most of the 
      garden beds are overrun with limp, dead grass- even the weeds haven't survived in here.<br><br>

      As you walk furthur into the greenhouse, toward the lighter end, you're hit by a new smell, even 
      more disgusting than the last. It's more fleshy, and has your hair standing on end. Even still, 
      you feel compelled to take a closer look. 

      Edging closer, you identify that the smell is coming from under a the remains of a pitifuly limp tree. 
      There is something spikey laying at it's foot. It's bigger than both of your fists, and pale brown. 
      You think of a small quilled creature.

    <div id="panel">
    <p>Flipping over the dead thing, you find an opening. 
      You drive your hands into the mound of rotten flesh. 
      A new wave of the stench washes over you.<br><br>

      The rotten heap is slick inside, with patches of black mould and small lumps of a 
      different texture. You pry one free.<br><br>

      Looking at the material under the scattered moonlight, you can see it's shriveled and yellow-orange. 
      It's squishy like an old kidney or dried fruit. It reeks like something between rotten egg and vinegar.<br><br>

      You squeeze it, and it splits, watery liquid flowing out and making your hands sticky. You nod to yourself, and 
      pick up the spikey hunk of flesh, turning it over in your hands.<br><br>

      Just as you thought, it has a shriveled stem. It's not an animal at all.

    document.getElementById("panel").style.display = "block";
    }
    </script>
    <p style="font-size:20px; color:#ffffff; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">
      You turn your attention to finding another way forwards. Looking back at the shared brick wall between 
      the inside of the greenhouse and the outside of the house, you notice a hatch close to the glass roof.<br>
      You find a ladder fallen nearby it, and right it again. It's rickety, but should be able to hold your weight.

<nav>
<p style="font-size: 20px; color:#ffffff; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">
    <br><br>The hatch looks quite small to fit through, so you consider going back through 
    the door you entered from. Though- is that the way you entered? There are a few stairs 
    leading up to this door, you don't recall going down any steps in your way in here.<br><br>

    Which way will you go?<br><br>
