    <p style="font-size: 20px; color:#ffffff; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">
    You are in an empty room.<br><br>

    The space is lit by a single yellowed lightbulb mounted to the wall. 
    To your left is a battered leather couch covered in a thick layer of dust. 
    You can see the imprint where Someone sat recently.<br><br>

    The only other furniture is a wooden coffee table with elegantly carved legs. 
    Gaps in the dust show where items- perhaps photo frames, or a tea set- once were.<br><br>

    <span style="color: #f4f7f5;">Stained wallpaper is peeling off the walls. Floorboards creak underfoot. 
    The air is thick as soup, swimming with grime and rot.</span><br><br>

    <span style="color: #e1e5e2;">You hear something dripping from the ceiling above you, 
    falling somewhere just ahead of you. </span><br>
    <span style="color: #d2d7d3;">You don't bother looking for the source of the sound.</span><br>
    <span style="color: #c0c6c2;">You know there is only Nothing.</span><br>
    <span style="color: #b2b8b4;">Ahead of you is only darkness.</span><br><br>

    <span style="color: #a5a9a7;">Even where the flickering light 
    should illuminate, there is only shadow.</span><br><br><br>


    <span style="color: #4e5250;">Darkness begins to creep into the edges of your vision.</span><br>
    <span style="color: #454847;">You rub your eyes instinctively, you know it won't go away.</span><br><br><br>


    <span style="color: #3e4543;"><b>You cannot </b>be here<b> anymore.</b></span><br><br><br>


    <span style="color: #242625;">There is only empty space before you. You can just barely 
    make out the shape of a window, but that vision fades too.</span><br><br>

    <span style="color: #1a1d1c;">You can't see your hand before your face anymore, like it isn't there at all.</span><br><br>
