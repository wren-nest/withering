    <h1 style="font-size:30px; color:#6a7160; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">The Greenhouse</h1>
</body>

<body>
  <p style="font-size:20px; color:#ffffff; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">
    <span style="color: #616846">You enter the greenhouse, and are immediately shocked by the cold. It feels unnaturally cool here, 
    not only far too cold for exotic plants to grow, but also far colder than it is outdoors. But far more 
    overwhelming is the smell. This room reeks of rot and death. Your stomach churns.</span><br><br>

    <span style="color: #676846">This room is open to the sky, lit by pale moonlight. The glass roof of this greenhouse is clouded by 
    grime and cobwebs, and a patchy layer of old leaves has collected over the roof, making the light 
    mottled and dull. At the far corner, however, several panels of glass have broken 
    and bright moonlight pours in.</span><br><br>

    <span style="color: #686346">You note the dead and shriveled vines that once climbed the span of the roof. Some dry stems have come 
    loose and hang from the ceiling alongside long strands of cobwebs.</span><br><br>
    
    <span style="color: #685b46">A rusted cart holds empty pots, you imagine young seeds 
    waiting to sprout but never getting the opportunity.</span><br><br>
    
    <span style="color: #685146">The garden beds are dry, barren of any hint of green. Most of them are overrun with 
    limp, dead grass- even the weeds haven't survived in here.</span><br><br>

    <span style="color: #6e4941">There are shriveled plants of incredible variety. Several beds are filled with stiff stems 
      and shriveled specks of petals, the remains of exotic flowers. There are dead bushes with 
      rotten berries of all kinds dripping over stiff leaves. Several trellises are covered in the 
      grotesque pulp of whatever fruits rotted off them. In one corner is a giant pumpkin, caved 
      in on itself and shriveled almost beyond recognition.</span><br><br>
    
    <span style="color: #684946">As you walk further into the greenhouse, toward the lighter end, you're hit by a new smell, even 
    more disgusting than the last. It's more fleshy, and has your hair standing on end. Even still, 
    you feel compelled to take a closer look. </span><br><br>

    <span style="color: #523535">Edging closer, you identify that the smell is coming from under the remains of a pitifully limp tree. 
    There is something like a spiked ball laying at its foot. It's bigger than both of your fists, and pale brown. 
    You think of a small quilled creature. </span>

      Investigate the corpse?  <span style="color:#323642;">(Click here)</span></p>

    <div id="panel" style="font-size: 20px; color:#7e2323; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">
    <p>
      Flipping over the dead thing, you find an opening. 
      You drive your hands into the mound of rotten flesh. 
      A new wave of the stench washes over you.<br><br>

      The rotten heap is slick inside, with patches of black mould and small lumps of a 
      different texture. You pry one free.<br><br>

      Looking at the material under the scattered moonlight, you can see it's shriveled and yellow-orange. 
      It's squishy like an old kidney or dried fruit. It reeks like something between rotten egg and vinegar.<br><br>

      You squeeze it, and it splits, watery liquid flowing out and making your hands sticky. You nod to yourself, and 
      pick up the spikey hunk of flesh, turning it over in your hands.<br><br>

      Just as you thought, it has a shriveled stem. You put the durian back where you found it.
    </p>
    </div>

    <script>
      function myFunction() {
      document.getElementById("panel").style.display = "block";
      }
      </script>

    <p style="font-size:20px; color:#ffffff; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">
      <span style="color: #3e2328">You turn your attention to finding another way forwards. Looking back at the shared brick wall between 
      the inside of the greenhouse and the outside of the house, you notice a hatch close to the glass roof.<br>
      You find a ladder fallen nearby it, and right it again. It's rickety, but should be able to hold your weight.</span>
    </p>

<nav>
<p style="font-size: 20px; color:#323a1e; font-family: Georgia; text-align: center;">
    <br><br>The hatch looks quite small to fit through, so you consider going back through 
    the door you entered from. Though- is that the way you entered? There are a few stairs 
    leading up to this door, you don't recall going down any steps in your way in here.<br><br>

    <span style="color: #404c2b;">Which way will you go?</span><br><br>

    <a href="where2.html" class="button">Up through the hatch</a>    
    <a href="glassroom4.html" class="button">Out the <span style="color: #333e19;">new</span> door</a></p>
